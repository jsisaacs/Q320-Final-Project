# Q320-Final-Project

I implemented a multi-layer perceptron to classify the survival rate of passengers aboard the Titanic.

The data_analysis.py file is where I try to sus out patterns from the train.csv file.

The NN.py is where I pre-processed the dataset, evaluated the classifier, ran a ROC curve validation, and created the submission csv file to submit on Kaggle.com.
